# Cross-rollup DEX with smart contracts only on the destination side

Suppose that we have two rollups, A and B, and Alice wishes to exchange some quantity of coins on rollup A for the same coins on rollup B. There are already [proposals](https://ethresear.ch/t/hop-send-tokens-across-rollups/8581) for how to do this in a decentralized way if A and B both have full smart contract support. This document proposes how to do it in the case where only rollup B has full smart contract support (and rollup A can only process simple transactions).

We assume that transactions on rollup A have some kind of “memo field”; if they do not, we can use lower-order digits of the value sent as a memo.

### Proposal

Suppose there is an exchange intermediary, Ivan (in a real implementation there would be many intermediaries to choose from). Ivan has an account `IVAN_A` on rollup A (that he fully controls). Ivan also has some funds deposited in a smart contract `IVAN_B` on rollup B.

The smart contract `IVAN_B` has the following rules:

- If anyone sends a transaction sending `TRADE_VALUE` coins to `IVAN_A`, containing an address `DESTINATION` as a memo, then after `MIN_REDEMPTION_DELAY` blocks they can send a transaction to `IVAN_B` containing a proof of the transfer, which queues a withdrawal of `TRADE_VALUE` coins to address `DESTINATION`.
- Withdrawals are processed after some delay (eg. 1 day) in order of the batch and index the transfers were included in on rollup A.
- When Ivan sees that he received funds at `IVAN_A`, he has the ability to personally send `TRADE_VALUE * (1 - fee)` coins to `DESTINATION`. He can do this by sending the transaction through a method in `IVAN_B`, which saves a record that prevents the automated-send clause in the contract from triggering for that trade.

The expected behavior is simple:

1. Alice sends a transaction to `IVAN_A` with N coins and a memo `ALICE_B`
2. Ivan sends a transaction sending `TRADE_VALUE * (1 - fee)` coins through `IVAN_B` to `ALICE_B`

The second step can happen immediately after the first step. The contract can even have rules that allow the `fee` to be greater if Ivan shows proof that the timestamp difference between the second transaction and the first is very low.

The “worst-case” behavior is if Ivan does *not* send coins to `ALICE_B` as he is expected to. In this case, Alice can wait until the transaction on rollup A confirms, find some alternate route to getting coins on rollup B to pay fees, and then simply claim the funds herself.

### Capital costs

The main limitation of the scheme is that `IVAN_B` needs to hold a large amount of capital to ensure that all senders will be paid. Particularly, suppose that:

- We place a trade size limit of `TRADE_LIMIT` coins (so transactions going to `IVAN_A` with `value > TRADE_LIMIT` are not valid trades)
- Each rollup batch can contain a maximum of `TXS_PER_BATCH` transactions

Alice can check herself how many unprocessed trades there are before the upcoming batch on rollup A, subtract this value from the capital she sees in the `IVAN_B` contract, and check if the remaining amount is enough. Because withdrawals are processed sequentially (this is the goal of the queue mechanism above), Alice need not concern herself with the possibility of future withdrawals being processed before her own.

The maximum amount that could be traded in one batch is `TRADE_LIMIT * TXS_PER_BATCH`, and so the `IVAN_B` contract needs to hold at least this amount of ETH, plus enough to cover unprocessed trades. As an example, suppose `TRADE_LIMIT = 0.1 ETH` (low limits are okay because a larger trade can be done with multiple transactions) and `TXS_PER_BATCH = 1000`. Then, `IVAN_B` would need to hold 100 ETH.

Note that there is an extra implicit fee in this design, because anyone trading more than 0.1 ETH would need to waste block space. This is traded off against capital requirements: if you halve the block waste, you double the capital requirements, and vice versa. It seems likely that the correct balance would be the point where the implicit fee is a few times smaller than the explicit fee that emerges in the market.

If we want to reduce or remove this waste, rollup A could be designed to do so, for example by having the sequencer send a signed message attesting to Alice all messages approved in the batch so far. Alice would then know that there are no trades before hers (though a malicious sequencer could, at high cost to themselves, trick Alice).

### Memos

The design above assumes that transactions on rollup A have a memo field that Alice can use to specify `ALICE_B` as her destination. If rollups do *not* have this feature, then we can use the following workaround. Alice can register `ALICE_B` on rollup B in a sequential registry contract, and get a sequentially assigned ID (so Alice’s ID equals the number of users who registered before her). Let `MAX_USER_COUNT` be a maximum on the user count; if necessary, this value could adjust upwards over time. Alice can simply ensure that `TRADE_VALUE % MAX_USER_COUNT` equals (Alice’s ID), using the low-order digits of `TRADE_VALUE`, which represent an inconsequential amount of value, to represent the amount she wants to trade.

### B to A trades

If Alice starts with coins on rollup B and moves them to rollup A, a similar mechanism can be used, except with reversed roles:

- Alice sends coins to `IVAN_B`
- After some delay, she gets the right to take the coins back
- She loses that right if Ivan can prove to `IVAN_B` that he sent Alice coins on rollup A
